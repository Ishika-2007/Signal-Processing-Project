# Audio Signal Denoising and Frequency Analysis in MATLAB 

This project demonstrates a simple but effective method to denoise an audio signal using a manually implemented FIR low-pass filter in MATLAB â€” all done without any additional toolboxes.


## Objective

- Load a built-in clean audio signal (`handel`)
- Add synthetic white Gaussian noise
- Apply a **moving average low-pass FIR filter** (implemented using basic MATLAB)
- Analyze the signal in both time and frequency domains
- Save and listen to the original, noisy, and filtered audio

## Features

- MATLAB-only (No toolboxes used)
- FIR filter via **moving average** method
- Time-domain and frequency-domain visualization
- Plots and output `.wav` files included
